# ThunderAI - Advanced Machine Learning Platform

ThunderAI is a comprehensive machine learning platform that provides an intuitive interface for training, managing, and deploying machine learning models. It supports multiple model architectures including BERT, GPT, LSTM, and custom transformers.

## Features

### 1. Model Training
- Support for multiple model architectures:
  - BERT for classification and sequence tasks
  - GPT for text generation
  - LSTM for sequence modeling
  - Custom transformers
- Real-time training monitoring
- Advanced hyperparameter configuration
- Training metrics visualization
- Automatic model checkpointing

### 2. Experiment Management
- Track multiple experiments
- Compare model performances
- Export experiment results
- Detailed metrics and visualizations
- Experiment versioning

### 3. Model Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- Resource utilization tracking
- Custom metric definitions
- Alert configuration
- Performance dashboards

### 4. User Management
- Secure authentication
- Role-based access control
- Guest access with limited functionality
- Profile management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (for caching)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thunderai.git
cd thunderai

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv thunderai-env
source thunderai-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: thunderai-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
./scripts/init_db.sh
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thunderai
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost
```

2. Configure model paths and other settings in `core/config.py`

## Usage Guide
